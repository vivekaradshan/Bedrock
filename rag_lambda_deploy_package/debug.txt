1. Navigate to the AWS Lambda console and select the 'JPMC_RAG_Application' function

2. In the function configuration, scroll down to the 'Layers' section

3. Click on 'Add a layer'

4. Choose 'AWS layers' and search for 'AWSLambda-Python3*-NumPy'

5. Select the appropriate NumPy layer that matches your function's Python runtime (python3.12)

6. Add the selected layer to your function

7. Scroll up to the 'Code' tab and open the 'rag_lambda_handler.py' file

8. Ensure that the numpy import is at the top of the file and not within any function:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   ```

9. Save the changes to the Lambda function code

10. Test the function again to verify that the numpy import error has been resolved

11. If the error persists, check the function's deployment package:
    - Ensure that numpy is not included in the deployment package
    - Remove any numpy directory or files if present in the package

12. If you're using a custom deployment package:
    - Create a new deployment package without including numpy
    - Update the Lambda function with the new deployment package

13. If the issue still occurs, consider increasing the Lambda function's memory:
    - Go to the 'Configuration' tab
    - Select 'General configuration'
    - Increase the 'Memory (MB)' to a higher value (e.g., 256 MB or 512 MB)
    - Save the changes

14. Test the function again after making these changes
